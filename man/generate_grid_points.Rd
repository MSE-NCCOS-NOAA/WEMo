\title{Generate a Grid of Points Over a Spatial Extent}
\usage{
generate_grid_points(site_point, expansion_dist, resolution)
}
\arguments{
\item{site_point}{A spatial point or set of points, either an \code{sf} object or
a \code{SpatVector}. The extent of this object defines the initial bounds of the
grid.}

\item{expansion_dist}{Numeric vector of length 1 or 2. Distance (in map
units) to expand the bounding box in the x and y directions. If a single
value is provided, it is used for both directions. To use the exact extent
of \code{site_point}, set this to \code{0}.}

\item{resolution}{Numeric vector of length 1 or 2. The spacing between grid
points in the x and y directions (in map units). If a single value is
provided, it is used for both directions.}
}
\value{
A grid of points with regular spacing, returned as the same class as
\code{site_point} (either \code{sf} or \code{SpatVector}).
}
\description{
Creates a regular grid of points covering the (optionally expanded) extent of
a spatial object at a specified resolution. Accepts either an \code{sf} object or
a \code{SpatVector} as input. The output will match the input class.
