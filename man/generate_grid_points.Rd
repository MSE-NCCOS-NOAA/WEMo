\title{Generate a Grid of Points Over a Spatial Extent}
\usage{
generate_grid_points(site_point, expansion_dist, resolution)
}
\arguments{
\item{site_point}{A \code{SpatVector}. The spatial object whose extent will define
the bounds of the grid.}

\item{expansion_dist}{Numeric vector of length 1 or 2. Distance (in map
units) to expand the bounding box in the x and y directions. If a single
value is provided, it is used for both directions. To prevent expansion and
use the exact bounding box of \code{site_point}, set this to \code{0}.}

\item{resolution}{Numeric vector of length 1 or 2. The spacing between grid
points in the x and y directions (in map units). If a single value is
provided, it is used for both directions.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatVector} of points spaced regularly over the (expanded) extent
of \code{site_point}.
}
\description{
Creates a regular grid of points covering the (optionally expanded) extent of
a \code{SpatVector} object at a specified resolution. Returns the grid as a
\code{SpatVector} of point geometry.
