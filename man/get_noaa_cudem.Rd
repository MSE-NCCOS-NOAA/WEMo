\usage{
get_noaa_cudem(
  lon,
  lat,
  radius_m,
  dest_dir = "NOAA_CUDEM",
  mosaic_and_crop = TRUE,
  output_file = "Cropped_Mosaic_Raster.tif",
  overwrite = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{lon}{Longitude in decimal degrees (WGS84).}

\item{lat}{Latitude in decimal degrees (WGS84).}

\item{radius_m}{Radius (in meters) around the point within which to search
for tiles.}

\item{dest_dir}{Directory to save downloaded files. Created if it does not
exist. Default is \code{"NOAA_CUDEM"}.}

\item{mosaic_and_crop}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), mosaics and crops the
downloaded rasters to the buffer. If FALSE, only downloads intersecting
tiles and returns their file paths.}

\item{output_file}{Optional file path to save the cropped mosaic. If NULL, no
file is written.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, re-download existing tiles and overwrite
existing output file.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, generates an interactive map to display the
relation between the available CUDEM data, the central point defined by
\code{lon} and \code{lat} and the buffer created by \code{radius_m}. This calls
\code{\link[=map_noaa_cudem]{map_noaa_cudem()}}}
}
\value{
A \code{terra::SpatRaster} if \code{mosaic_and_crop = TRUE}; otherwise
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if downloads completed, or \code{NULL} if no tiles were
within the radius.

\description{
Download (and optionally make into a cropped mosaic raster)
Bathymetric-Topographic rasters files from from NOAA's Continuously Updated
Digital Elevation Model (CUDEM) near a specified location. Rasters are at
Ninth Arc-Second Resolution.
}
\details{
NOAA's CUDEM is a large raster layer that is broken into smaller
rasters called tiles. NOAA provides a tile index file that defines the
boundaries of these tiles and allows users to identify and download the
relevant tiles for their uses. The function identifies relevant tiles by
their proximity (intersecting with a buffer around the point of radius
\code{radius_m}) to the provided location. Rasters are downloaded to the user
defined directory \code{dest_dir}.

If \code{mosaic_and_crop} is \code{TRUE}, downloaded rasters are stitched together in
a mosaic raster and then cropped to a square centered on the provided point
with with edges of length two times \code{radius_m}. This cropped mosaic raster
is saved to \code{det_dir} with filename \code{output_file}. If \code{mosaic_and_crop} is
\code{FALSE}, The individual tiles are downloaded only.
